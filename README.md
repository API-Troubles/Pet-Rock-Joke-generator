# Rock Joke Generator

Did you want some horrible rock jokes? Well, you've arrived! This site provides a new* rock-related joke on refresh.

*There are 200 jokes contained within the JSON file for this project, so maybe not new if you refresh 200 times haha.

## Notices:
Thanks to Dave Alger for the dialogue box used in this project! I modified his to change the colours and moved the pointy triangle thing to the right.

ChatGPT was used for this project purely to generate the jokes used. Nowhere on the internet could I find a rock joke generator, so AI is the answer!
